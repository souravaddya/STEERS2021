        <h2>About STEERS</h2>
        <hr>
        <p align="justify">
          With the widespread popularity of Amazon AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Function,
          Microsoft Azure Functions, etc., Serverless Computing has gained
          significant impetus in recent times because of its simplicity. It is the
          next generation cloud service delivery paradigm and is also known as
          Function as a Service (FaaS). Almost all big players in the cloud have
          successfully launched commercially usable serverless computing platforms,
          although there are many open challenges in terms of their scalability and
          applicability for widespread deployments. These challenges are many-fold,
          starting from developing light-weight sandboxing platforms for FaaS
          supports, deciding optimal deployment strategies for function deployments,
          increasing the consolidation ratio of the functions, development of
          economic models for end-users as well as cloud service providers for their
          individual profit maximization, and so on. Given that majority of the cloud
          service providers now support serverless computing and direct function
          execution over the cloud platforms, a thorough investigation of the support
          systems is necessary through cutting-edge researches in this field.

        <p>
          This workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to
          exchange innovative ideas, latest research findings, practical experiences,
          lessons learned, and future directions to propel the research on serverless
          computing.

          In addition to research papers STEERS also invites submission in the following three categories:
        </p>

        <h5>Challenge Papers</h5>
        <p>
        The conference invites submissions of Challenge papers that present revolutionary new ideas that challenge existing assumptions prevalent among the serverless community and cloud community in general. These "challenge papers" should provide stimulating ideas that may open up exciting avenues and/or influence the direction of future serverless research. Exhaustive evaluation of the proposed ideas is not necessary in tis category, instead insight and in-depth understanding of the issues is expected. Challenge papers should be submitted using the same submission procedure adopted for the regular papers. Accepted Challenge papers will also be included in the proceedings. The title of these papers must bear a "Challenge:" prefix.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Experience Papers</h5>
        <p>
        The conference invites submission of Experience papers that present the details and insights from real-life testbeds and/or large scale experimental platforms around the research topics mentioned above. Such papers should provide detailed insights into (1) building the testbeds/platforms, (2) lessons that are impractical in a research setup, and (3) implications for further research in the relevant domain. Experience papers shall follow the same submission process as the regular papers with an “Experience:” prefix in the title. Accepted Experience papers will also be included in the proceedings.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Verification Papers</h5>
        <p>
        The conference invites submission of Verification papers that seek to validate and/or characterize recent results in serverless computing methodologies. The goal of these papers are to thoroughly characterize the parameters under which previously published results can be reproduced. Verification papers shall follow the same submission process as the regular papers with an “Verification:” prefix in the title. Accepted Verification papers will also be included in the proceedings.
